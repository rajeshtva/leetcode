# 218. The Skyline Problem

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/)
**Level**: Hard

**Memory Use**: 17.1 MB

**Time**: 70 ms

**Explanation**:

- first identify all possible points that could be in answer,
- use a way to distinct starting points from end points. (starting points heights are marked -ve and ending heights are marked +ve)
- all those points will be traversed sequentially. so sorting is required.
- maintain a priority queue (max heap) for storing current heights. the top will be the highest building at any point.
- heights of starting points will be pushed in the priority queue. and when end point of any height is encountered then it will be poped.
- previous height is also required to know what is the current maximum height.
- the answers will be points where maximum height changes since only these points will be visible in silhoutte.
- use map for implementing priority queue because random elements can be deleted from c++ priority queue implementation by default.

- **Space complexity**: $O(1)$
  **time complexity**: $O(n)$

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& buildings)
    {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        vector<vector<int>> points;

        trasformBuilding(buildings, points);

        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return (a[0] == b[0]) ? (a[1] < b[1]) : (a[0] < b[0]);
        });

        map<int, int> mp;
        mp[0] = 1;

        int previousHeight = 0;

        for (auto& p : points) {
            // put in queue
            if (p[1] < 0) {
                mp[-p[1]]++;
            } else {
                // if height is +ve, the pop that element.
                mp[p[1]]--;
                if (mp[p[1]] == 0) {
                    mp.erase(p[1]);
                }
            }

            if (previousHeight != mp.rbegin()->first) {
                result.push_back({ p[0], mp.rbegin()->first });
                previousHeight = mp.rbegin()->first;
            }
            // put in answer, the current x,y ,
        }
