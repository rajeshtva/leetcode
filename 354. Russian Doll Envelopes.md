# 354. Russian Doll Envelopes

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/russian-doll-envelopes/)
**Level**: Medium

**Memory Use**: MB

**Time**: ms

**Explanation**:

- uses concept based on the `longest increasing subsequence` problem.
- but firstly sorting is required in order to form a sequence where we can choose smaller envelopes first and then bigger envelopes.

**Space complexity**: $O(n)$ to store cache array
**time complexity**: $O(n^2)$

**But causes TLE**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEnvelopes(vector<vector<int>>& envelopes)
    {
        sort(envelopes.begin(), envelopes.end());

        int n = envelopes.size();
        vector<int> memo(n, 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int maxVal = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (envelopes[j][0] < envelopes[i][0]
                    && envelopes[j][1] < envelopes[i][1]) {
                    maxVal = max(maxVal, memo[j]);
                }

                memo[i] = maxVal + 1;
            }
        }

        return *max_element(memo.begin(), memo.end());
    }
};

```
## approach using binary search to find the lower bound.
**Explanation:** 
-   the idea is first to sort in ascending order by first element, and descending order the 2nd element. This way we will get largest height for any width first. therefore subsequent smaller heights can be ignored., means we are keeping only larger height than previous larget value.
and replace existing one if some smaller values are found. 
-   solely focusing on heights, not on width. as all envelopes are already sorted according to their widths.
- binary search will return either the index of that value or the smallest value which is just larger than current one.
-   we are keeping  track of heights for two reasons.
    -   first if (5,3) & (5,2) are encountered, then 3 will be inserted first, which will be replaced by 2.
    -   if (4,4) & (6,4) will encountered, then at that time, (6,4) will change only previous 4, 
    - this way we are minimizing the smallest envelope height as well as rejecting envelopes which are not strictly increasing.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEnvelopes(vector<vector<int>>& envelopes)
    {
        sort(envelopes.begin(), envelopes.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            if (a[0] < b[0])
                return true;

            else if (a[0] == b[0]) {
                return a[1] > b[1];
            }

            else
                return false;
        });

        int n = envelopes.size();
        vector<int> memo;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            auto itr = lower_bound(memo.begin(), memo.end(), envelopes[i][1]);

            if (itr == memo.end()) {
                memo.push_back(envelopes[i][1]);
            } else {
                *itr = envelopes[i][1];
            }
        }

        return memo.size();
    }

};

```
