# 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/)
**Level**: Medium

**Memory Use**: 13.8 MB

**Time**: 172 ms

**Explanation**:

- question based on longest increasing subsequence.
- along with keeping track of what is the current state of i'th number, also keep track of what are the numbers of subsequence of which that one is ending element.
- The total number of all subsequence which ends at any particular number will be equal to the the sum of count of all possible subsequence which will take current element as next number in their sequence. **for example**. lets' assume that a number `k` is `10`th number of a sequence. then total number of sequence which ends at 10 as last number will be equal to sum of all subsequence which ends at `9`.

**Space complexity**: $O(1)$
**time complexity**: $O(n)$

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findNumberOfLIS(vector<int>& nums)
    {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<pair<int, int>> dp(n, { 1, 1 });

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[i] && (dp[i].first <= 1 + dp[j].first)) {

                    if (max(dp[i].first, dp[j].first + 1) != dp[i].first) {
                        dp[i].second = dp[j].second;
                    } else {
                        dp[i].second += dp[j].second;
                    }

                    dp[i].first = dp[j].first + 1;
                }
            }
        }

        int answer = INT_MIN;
        int maxLength = INT_MIN;

        map<int, int> mp;

        for (auto& itr : dp) {
            mp[itr.first] += itr.second;
        }

        return mp.rbegin()->second;
    }
};

```
