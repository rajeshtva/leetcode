# Maximum Product of Word Lengths | Leetcode 318

[link]()
**Level**: Medium

**Memory Use**: MB

**Time**: ms

**Explanation**:

- bitwise manipulation.
- we mark occurance of a character in a word by shifting last $1$ bit $ch- a$ times to left
- we also do $or$ operation on the characters of word in order to make character combination of word as a integer.
- we perform $&$ operation to check if they have similar character combination or not.

**Space complexity**: $O(1)$
**time complexity**: $O(n)$

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<string>& words)
    {
        int n = words.size();
        int a = 1, b = 1;
        int answer = 0;
        vector<int> value(n, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int temp = 0;
            for (char ch : words[i]) {
                int a = 1;
                a = a << (ch - 'a');
                temp = temp | a;
            }

            value[i] = temp;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if ((value[i] & value[j]) == 0) {
                    answer = max(answer, (int)(words[i].size() * words[j].size()));
                }
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }
};

```
