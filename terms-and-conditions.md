Welcome to Terms and Conditions for Codalay. These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) are between Codalay and You ( hereinafter referred to as ‘You’, ‘Your’ or ‘User(s)’ ). Please note that your use of the https://www.codalay.in/ or https://practice.codalay.in/ (‘Websites’) website and/or subscription to Premium or Premium Plus membership are also governed by the agreements listed below, as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, privacy policies, and requirements on the Codalay website, all of which (as changed over time) are incorporated into these Terms. Every time you visit, browse, or use your Codalay Premium/Premium Plus Subscription, you accept this Agreement.

## Subscription & Eligibility

Codalay Premium/Premium Plus (‘the subscription service’) is a personalized Subscription that offers, recommends and helps you discover digital educational content (collectively, "Educational Content") in the category of your interest. You can access the Subscription and Educational Content, through the Codalay website by subscribing to any category of your choice from the available subscription plans - Premium/Premium Plus (“Subscription”). The Subscription will allow you ad-free access to all the Educational content that is available on Codalay website and app during your Subscription Period. We also provide direct access to open discussion forums* and one-on-one Doubt Assistance*. We also endeavor to continuously improve the Subscriptions and subscription plans to improve your subscription experience.

These features are only available to premium plus subscribers.

## Compatible devices

In order to access our educational content you will need to use a personal computer, or other device that meets the system and compatibility requirements (a "Compatible Device"). The Compatible Devices may change from time to time and, in some cases, whether a device is (or remains) a Compatible Device may depend on software or systems provided or maintained by the device manufacturer or other third parties. Accordingly, devices that are Compatible Devices at one time may cease to be Compatible Devices in the future. Thus, kindly make sure that the device that you use is compatible with our system/software to avail the Subscription Service.

## Educational content

The Premium Subscription allows you access to ad-free Educational Content on a subscription basis for viewing, for a limited period of time during the Subscription Period and the Premium Plus subscription allows you access to added benefits like Discussion forums, Doubt Assistance Platform and one-on-one help session.

### Usage Rules

Due to the limitations imposed on us by our Educational Content providers i.e. Educators, the Educational Content we make available to you on Codalay Premium/Premium Plus Subscription are subject to restrictions on viewing access and on the length of time we make them available to you.

Premium Plus members get additional access to extra features like discussion forums and one-on-one doubt help sessions that Premium subscribers cannot access without upgrading. The user can only upgrade to a Premium Plus plan from an ongoing Premium plan by paying the difference amount that would be calculated on the basis of the remaining days in the users’ current billing cycle.

### Subscription & Payment
