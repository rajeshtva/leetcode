        if (n == 1) {
            trees.push_back(new TreeNode(0));
        } else if (n % 2) {
            // means this tree is only possible when there are odd numbers of root.
            // one node will go into root, rest nodes will be divided between two odd
            // numbers of nodes, which will form child trees.
            // because the question is asked to find the total number of complete binary trees
            // which either has 0 or 2 children.

            // loop is starting from 2 because this will help in dividing whole nodes in 2 parts.
            // first will have i-1 nodes, other will have n-i nodes.

            for (int i = 2; i < n; i += 2) {
                auto left = allPossibleFBT(i - 1);
                auto right = allPossibleFBT(n - i);

                for (int leftI = 0; leftI < left.size(); leftI++) {
                    for (int rightI = 0; rightI < right.size(); rightI++) {
                        trees.push_back(new TreeNode(0));
                        // now during iteration suppose, a child subtree will be accessed and
                        // we will assign them to the left or right child.

                        // for that we don't want 1. memory leak which will occur if we just don't use any returned value.
                        // 2. we want efficient method.

                        // so we are reusing whatever is returned from the recursive calls. that is why if we see that a child tree is not going to be needed.
                        // we use them as it is. i.e.. we assign it to left or right pointer.
                        trees.back()->left = (rightI == right.size() - 1) ? left[leftI] : clone(left[leftI]);
                        trees.back()->right = (leftI == left.size() - 1) ? right[rightI] : clone(right[rightI]);
                    }
                }
            }
