# 1473. Paint House III

[link]()
**Level**: Medium
**Explanation**:
- it is a top-down dp approach, because we are calculating the values while goint top to down. at the end we are not calculating instead we are calculating while going down.
- This example is copied.. even i didn't understand time complexity calculation (or space complexity)
- this question is a child of simple backtracking algorithm.
- imagine a question only to check for `target` but you have to find min cost to paint.
- in that question check for all values possible & calculate min value for all combination of houses, paint and target.
- just extra complexity added here is that house can be colored too.
- so solution is simple: simple backtracking.


**Space complexity**: $O(m*n^2)$
**time complexity**: $O(m*n^2)$

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int MAX = 1e8;
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> memo;
    vector<vector<int>> cost;
    vector<int> houses;
    int m, n, target;

    int minCost(vector<int>& houses, vector<vector<int>>& cost, int m, int n, int target)
    {
        this->memo = move(vector<vector<vector<int>>>(101,
            vector<vector<int>>(21,
                vector<int>(101,
                    -1))));

        this->houses = move(houses);
        this->cost = move(cost);
        this->m = move(m);
        this->n = move(n);
        this->target = move(target);

        int value = dfs(0, 0, 0);

        return value >= MAX ? -1 : value;
    }

    int dfs(int currentI, int p, int t)
    {
        if (currentI == m && target == t)
            return 0;

        if (currentI >= m)
            return MAX;

        if (memo[currentI][p][t] != -1)
            return memo[currentI][p][t];

        int minVal = INT_MAX;

        if (houses[currentI] != 0) {
            minVal = dfs(currentI + 1, houses[currentI], t + (houses[currentI] != p));
        } else {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                minVal = min(minVal,
                    cost[currentI][j] + dfs(currentI + 1, j + 1, t + (j + 1 != p)));
            }
        }

        return memo[currentI][p][t] = minVal;
    }
};
```
