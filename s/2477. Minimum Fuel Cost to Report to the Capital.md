# 2477. Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital

[link]()
**Level**: Medium 
**Explanation**:
- `peopleCount` keeps count of children of each node for each node. 
- the function returns total fuel required to reach to that calling node. 
- at each stage, i am keeping track of total people reaching to that node.

**Space complexity**: $O(n)$
**time complexity**: $O(n)$

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    typedef long long ll;
    vector<vector<ll>> adjList;
    vector<ll> peopleCount;
    ll s;

    long long minimumFuelCost(vector<vector<int>>& roads, int seats)
    {
        int n = roads.size() + 1;
        adjList = move(vector<vector<ll>>(n));
        peopleCount = move(vector<ll>(n));
        this->s = seats;

        for (auto it : roads) {
            adjList[it[0]].push_back(it[1]);
            adjList[it[1]].push_back(it[0]);
        }

        return dfs(0, -1);
    }

    ll dfs(int i, int parent)
    {
        ll fuel = 0;
        ll people = 0;
        ll cars = 0;

        for (auto it : adjList[i]) {
            if (it == parent)
                continue;

            fuel += dfs(it, i);
            ll nodePeople = 1 + peopleCount[it];
            ll temp = nodePeople / s;
            if (nodePeople % s > 0)
                temp++;
            fuel += temp;
            people += nodePeople;
        }

        peopleCount[i] = people;

        return fuel;
    }
};
