# 2039. The Time When the Network Becomes Idle

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-time-when-the-network-becomes-idle/)
**Level**: Medium 
**Explanation**:
- main idea is to find the last time any node receives a message. 
- a trip back to data server takes 2 * distance time. 
- a data server stops broadcasting the first time it receives a message.  last time it could have broadcasted would be $2*distance[i] - 1$. so last time it would broadcast message is $$ s = ((2*distance[i]-1) / patience[i])*patience[i] $$. 
- so last time it would receive would be $$ t =  s*distance[i] $$. 
- then take max of all values. the first idle time would be next second of it. 

**Space complexity**: $O(n)$
**time complexity**: $O(n + e)$

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int networkBecomesIdle(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& patience) {
         int n = patience.size();
         vector<int>adjList[n];

         vector<int>distance(n, INT_MAX);

         distance[0]=0;

        for(auto &it: edges) {
            adjList[it[0]].push_back(it[1]);
            adjList[it[1]].push_back(it[0]);
        }

        queue<int>q;

        q.push(0); // server node. 

        // finding shortest path to all nodes from server.
        while(!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();

            q.pop();

            for(auto it: adjList[node]) {
                if(distance[node] + 1 < distance[it]) {
                    distance[it]=distance[node]+1;
                    q.push(it);
                }
            }
        }

        int lastTimeMessageReceived = 0, lastTimeMessageSent, times = INT_MAX;

        // finding last time a data server sent a message to main server.
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            times = (2*distance[i]-1) / patience[i];

            lastTimeMessageSent = times * patience[i];

            lastTimeMessageReceived = max(lastTimeMessageSent + distance[i]*2, lastTimeMessageReceived);

        }

        return lastTimeMessageReceived + 1;
    }
};
