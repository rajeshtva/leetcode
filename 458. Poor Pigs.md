[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/)
**Level**: Medium
**Explanation**:

- concept of bit manipulation at bit level
- T: no of rounds.
- (T+1)\*\*pigs > N => return pigs;

**Space complexity**: $O(1)$
**time complexity**: $O(n)$

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int d = minutesToTest/minutesToDie;

        int pigs = 0;

        while(pow(d+1, pigs) < buckets)
            pigs++;

        return pigs;
    }
};
