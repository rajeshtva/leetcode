# 907. Sum of Subarray Minimums

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/)
**Level**: Medium
**Explanation**:

- question based on monotonic stack, concept and dynamic programming.

- **Space complexity**: $O(n)$
  **time complexity**: $O(n)$

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    typedef long long ll;
    int sumSubarrayMins(vector<int>& arr)
    {
        int n = arr.size();
        ll answer = 0;
        int M = 1e9 + 7;

        vector<int> lnse(n), rnse(n);

        // by using monotonic stack concept, left next smaller elemnt, and right next smaller element is calculated,

        lnse[0] = -1;
        rnse[n - 1] = n;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
             /* instead of maintaining stack as in standard method. p is
              initlaized to neighbour, then we keep going left side to look
               for index where we find element just smaller than current
               element.  It is just like asking neighbour if they have seen
               anyone poorer than you if you know that they are either
               richer or equally richer to you. */

            // by default -1 is poorest.
            int p = i - 1;

            while (p >= 0 && arr[p] >= arr[i]) {
                p = lnse[p];
            }
            lnse[i] = p;
        }

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            /* similar explanation as in left, but we are going right side
             of current. by default n is poorer than everyone., the guy who
              does'nt even exist. */
            int p = i + 1;

            // for considering duplicate cases. arr[p] >= arr[i] is avoided
            // and equality sign is not used.
            while (p < n && arr[p] > arr[i]) {
                p = rnse[p];
            }
            rnse[i] = p;
        }

        ll l, r; // int types causes sign value overflow.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // l gives the difference of indices of current and the element who is smaller than current. same with r.

            //l*r will give total number of substring possible where current element is smallest.

            // we are not including the indices of element which is smaller than current.

            l = i - lnse[i];
            r = rnse[i] - i;

            answer = (answer + (l * r * arr[i]*1ll)) % M;
        }

        return (int)answer;
    }
