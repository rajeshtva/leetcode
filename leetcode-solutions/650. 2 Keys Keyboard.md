## what solution says. $O(sqrt(n))$ 
**Explanation:** 
- this approach uses prime factorisation concepts.

## what i did and got accepted. 
**Explanation**:
- this approach uses simple recursion.
- the only problem we need to consider is that we have to check for infinite depth of recursion as in the beginning itself, the two calls are going to be same, as we wont be careful.
- so instead of just passing current as clipboard, i did 2 step manually.

**Space complexity**: $O(n^2)$
**time complexity**: $O(n)$

```cpp
class Solution {

public:
    int minSteps(int n)
    {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;

        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));

        return 1 + g(n - 1, 1, 1, dp);
    }

    int g(int remained, int current, int clipboard, vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        int withoutcopy = 0, copied = 0;

        if (remained < 0)
            return 1e9;
        if (remained == 0)
            return 0;

        if (dp[remained][clipboard] != -1)
            return dp[remained][clipboard];

        // continue without copying,
        withoutcopy = 1 + g(remained - clipboard, current + clipboard, clipboard, dp);
        // copy and change clipboard
        copied = 2 + g(remained - current, current * 2, current, dp);

        int answer = min(withoutcopy, copied);
        dp[remained][clipboard] = answer;
        return answer;
    }
};
