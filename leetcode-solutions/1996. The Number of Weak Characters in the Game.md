# The Number of Weak Characters in the Game

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-weak-characters-in-the-game/)
**Level**: Medium 

**Memory Use**:   MB

**Time**:  ms

**Explanation**:
-   pairs are sorted according to decreasing by first element, and increasing by second element.
- the intuition behind this is that: 
    - all characters with same attack who lie previously have less defence. so there won't be any conflict with them.
    - so a characters  which has higher defence, must alway have higher attack. hence considered characters is weak.

**Space complexity**: $O(1)$
**time complexity**: $O(n)$

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWeakCharacters(vector<vector<int>>& properties)
    {
        sort(properties.begin(), properties.end(), compare);

        int count = 0;
        int n = properties.size();
        int maxDefenceTillNow = INT_MIN;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (properties[i][1] < maxDefenceTillNow)
                count++;
            else
                maxDefenceTillNow = max(maxDefenceTillNow, properties[i][1]);
        }

        return count;
    }

    static bool compare(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b)
    {
        if (a[0] != b[0])
            return a[0] > b[0];
        else
            return a[1] < b[1];
    }
};
```
